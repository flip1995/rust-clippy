### What it does
Finds patterns of unchecked subtraction of [`Duration`] from [`Instant::now()`].

### Why is this bad?
Unchecked subtraction could cause underflow on certain platforms, leading to bugs and/or
unintentional panics.

### Example
```
let time_passed = Instant::now() - Duration::from_secs(5);
```

Use instead:
```
let time_passed = Instant::now().checked_sub(Duration::from_secs(5));
```

[`Duration`]: std::time::Duration
[`Instant::now()`]: std::time::Instant::now;
